As outlined in the [syntax guide](./syntax), Hacss supports variables (i.e.
named constants) and at-scopes (e.g. media queries). These features require a
small amount of configuration.

# Configuration Module

Both the [CLI](./cli) and the [Webpack integration](./webpack) will look for a
`hacss.config.js` file in the working directory (i.e. the project root). You can
specify an alternate configuration file path by using the explicit `config`
option. See the [CLI](./cli) and [Webpack](./webpack) guides for more
information.

The configuration module must export an object, which can contain either or both
of the keys `atScopes` and `variables`.

# Variables

This is a map of variables that can be used in style rules. A rule
`:hover{color:$red500}`, for example, requires a corresponding key `red500` in
the `variables` map.

You can also define variables for specific properties. For example, you may want
a variable `small` to have a different value depending on the CSS property where
it is used: Properties like `box-shadow`, `font-size`, and `border-radius` might
all have some notion of a "small" variant. To define a variable for a specific
property, simply nest it within another map as shown in the configuration
example below.

## Variable Configuration Example

```javascript
exports.variables = {
  red500: "#c33",
  "box-shadow": {
    small: "0 2px 2px #0003"
  },
  "font-size": {
    small: "12px"
  },
  "border-radius": {
    small: "2px"
  }
};
```

# At-scopes

This is a map of at-scopes that can be used in style rules. A rule
`@small{padding:0}`, for example, requires a corresponding key `small` in the
`atScopes` map.

## At-scope Configuration Example

```javascript
exports.atScopes = {
  small: "media only screen and (max-width: 599px)",
  medium: "media only screen and (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1199px)",
  large: "media only screen and (min-width: 1200px)",
};
```
