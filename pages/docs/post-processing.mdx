  subtitle="Add more capabilities to Hacss with PostCSS plugins">

The static style sheet that Hacss produces is fully compatible with
[PostCSS](https://postcss.org), which makes it easy to add capabilities to Hacss
using a large catalog of [PostCSS plugins](https://www.postcss.parts). While
PostCSS plugins are often designed to ease the burden of authoring a style
sheet, many of them remain useful and relevant even in the context of "inline
styles". Below are a few ideas to get you started.

To use these plugins with Hacss, start with the Hacss [CLI](./cli),
[Webpack integration](./webpack), or [API](./api). Once Hacss is integrated into
your build process, consult the
[PostCSS setup](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage) as needed.
Essentially, you will provide PostCSS the style sheet produced by Hacss the same
as if you had authored the style sheet yourself manually.

## [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)

Autoprefixer is a popular utility that automatically adds vendor prefixes to
your CSS as needed. For example, you can simply write `appearance:none;` in your
code, and Autoprefixer will automatically add `-ms-appearance`,
`-moz-appearance`, and various other vendor-prefixed versions to the Hacss
output. Similarly, you can write `::placeholder{color:gray}`, and Autoprefixer
will automatically create the vendor-prefixed versions, meaning that there is no
need to write `::-ms-input-placeholder{color:gray}` for IE compatibility, for
example.

## [css-mqpacker](https://github.com/hail2u/node-css-mqpacker)

This plugin offers a performance optimization that is highly recommended for
non-trivial projects. Any two rules that use the same media query will be
grouped together within a single media query block, reducing the size of your
CSS output.

## [axis](https://github.com/kinday/postcss-axis)

The axis plugin supports additional shorthand properties not available natively
in CSS, such as:
* `padding-x`, expanded to `padding-left` and `padding-right`
* `margin-y`, expanded to `margin-top` and `margin-bottom`
* `border-x-color`, exapnded to `border-top-color` and `border-bottom-color`

You can use these in Hacss rules just like you would use them in a style sheet,
e.g. `border-x-width:1px;`.

## [pxtorem](https://github.com/cuth/postcss-pxtorem)

This plugin allows you to think in terms of pixels without losing the benefits
of relative units. Write a rule like `width:512px;` and it will be rendered as
`.width\:512px\;{width:32rem}`.

You could also consider the [Shortcuts](./shortcuts) package which includes
various length presets aliased in terms of pixels, but this might be an
interesting option if you're not using Shortcuts for whatever reason.

## [lost](https://github.com/peterramsing/lost)

Grid system APIs usually exist as a system of CSS classes that you have to learn
or preprocessor mixins that require you to use a specific preprocessor such as
Sass or Less. LostGrid's API is somewhat unique in that it is based on special
CSS properties that work with any preprocessor or, in our case, the style sheet
output of Hacss. You can use a style rule like `lost-column:1/3;` and the
LostGrid plugin will transform the resulting CSS automatically.
