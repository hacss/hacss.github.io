  subtitle="Build your site faster with Hacss Shortcuts">

With the optional Shortcuts package, you can immediately focus on building your
site without creating a Hacss configuration or worrying about the lower-level 
units of your design. The Shortcuts package provides a configuration that is
ready to use or extend, complete with a color palette, fonts, spacing presets,
shadows, and more.

# Installation

To get started, install the
[@hacss/shortcuts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hacss/shortcuts) package:

<ShellCommand>
  npm install @hacss/shortcuts
</ShellCommand>

Then create a `hacss.config.js` file that exports a configuration from
`@hacss/shortcuts`:

```javascript
const shortcuts = require("@hacss/shortcuts");
module.exports = shortcuts();
```

# Usage

The Shortcuts package is just an ordinary Hacss configuration and includes a
number of breakpoints and variables. Review the [syntax](./syntax) and
[configuration](./configuration) guides for more information.

# Available Shortcuts

## Colors

The included color palette includes several base color options, each with a full
range of shades and tints. It offers both flexibility and consistency by
providing numerous options but not too many.

<ShortcutColors />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Lengths

These length abstractions improve the consistency of your layout by providing a
finite set of options for padding, margins, and other length properties. They
also allow you to think in terms of pixels while actually mapping to relative
units behind the scenes: For example, `$len16` has an underlying value of `1rem`.

<ShortcutLengths />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Borders

Like the length shortcuts, border widths are limited in number and aliased in
terms of pixels, so choosing the right border width for your use case requires
little effort.

<ShortcutBorders />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Typography

Use these variables with the
[font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) shorthand property.
Not only is this more convenient than setting constituent properties
individually, but also it improves typographical consistency throughout your
site. If you need to override a constituent property, you can always use a rule
priority as explained in the [syntax guide](./syntax).
