  subtitle="Build your site faster with Hacss Shortcuts">

With the optional Shortcuts package, you can immediately focus on building your
site without creating a Hacss configuration or worrying about the lower-level 
units of your design. The Shortcuts package provides a configuration that is
ready to use or extend, complete with a color palette, fonts, spacing presets,
shadows, and more.

# Installation

To get started, install the
[`@hacss/shortcuts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hacss/shortcuts) package:

<ShellCommand>
  npm install @hacss/shortcuts
</ShellCommand>

Then create a `hacss.config.js` file that exports a configuration from
`@hacss/shortcuts`:

```javascript
const shortcuts = require("@hacss/shortcuts");
module.exports = shortcuts();
```

# Usage

The Shortcuts package is essentially just an ordinary Hacss configuration and
includes a number of breakpoints and variables. Review the [syntax](./syntax)
and [configuration](./configuration) guides for more information.

# Available Shortcuts

## Colors

The color palette includes several base colors, each with a full range of shades
and tints. It provides a number of options that is small enough to promote
consistency throughout your site yet large enough to satisfy most use cases.

<ShortcutColors />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Lengths

These length abstractions improve the consistency of your layout by providing a
finite set of options for padding, margins, and other length properties. They
also allow you to think in terms of pixels while actually mapping to relative
units behind the scenes: For example, `$len16` has an underlying value of `1rem`.

<ShortcutLengths />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Typography

Use these variables with the
[`font`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) shorthand
property. Not only is this more convenient than setting constituent properties
individually, but also it improves typographical consistency throughout your
site. If you need to override a constituent property, you can always use a rule
priority as explained in the [syntax guide](./syntax).

<ShortcutFonts />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Box Shadows

These work with the `box-shadow` property and can be used to emphasize an
element by adding elevation.

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Borders

Like the length shortcuts, border widths are limited in number and aliased in
terms of pixels, so choosing the right border width for your use case requires
little effort.

<ShortcutBorders />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Corner Radii

The corner radius variables work with the `border-radius` property and its
various constituent properties (`border-top-left-radius`,
`border-top-right-radius`, etc.)

<ShortcutCornerRadii />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Focus Outlines

Custom focus outlines are often achieved with the
[`box-shadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)
property. The Shortcuts package offers a large set of outline box shadows based
on its color palette.

Before applying these, you should suppress the browser's default outline using
an `outline:$none;` class. The `$none` variable provides a transparent outline
rather than removing it completely, providing a better experience in Windows
High Contrast Mode as explained
[here](https://sarahmhigley.com/writing/whcm-quick-tips/).
