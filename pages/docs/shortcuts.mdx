With the optional Shortcuts package, you can immediately focus on building your
site without creating a Hacss configuration or worrying about the lower-level 
units of your design. The Shortcuts package provides a configuration that is
ready to use or extend, complete with a color palette, fonts, spacing presets,
shadows, and more.

# Installation

To get started, install the
[`@hacss/shortcuts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hacss/shortcuts) package:

<ShellCommand>
  npm install @hacss/shortcuts
</ShellCommand>

Then create a `hacss.config.js` file that exports a configuration from
`@hacss/shortcuts`:

```javascript
const shortcuts = require("@hacss/shortcuts");
module.exports = shortcuts();
```

# Usage

The Shortcuts package is essentially just an ordinary Hacss configuration and
includes a number of breakpoints and variables. Review the [syntax](./syntax)
and [configuration](./configuration) guides for more information.

# Available Shortcuts

## Colors

The color palette includes several base colors, each with a full range of shades
and tints. It provides a number of options that is small enough to promote
consistency throughout your site yet large enough to satisfy most use cases.

<ShortcutColors />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Lengths

These length abstractions improve the consistency of your layout by providing a
finite set of options for padding, margins, and other length properties. They
also allow you to think in terms of pixels while actually mapping to relative
units behind the scenes: For example, `$len16` has an underlying value of `1rem`.

<ShortcutLengths />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Typography

Use these variables with the
[`font`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) shorthand
property. Not only is this more convenient than setting constituent properties
individually, but also it improves typographical consistency throughout your
site. If you need to override a constituent property, you can always use a rule
priority as explained in the [syntax guide](./syntax).

<ShortcutFonts />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Box Shadows

These work with the `box-shadow` property and can be used to emphasize an
element by adding elevation.

<ShortcutBoxShadows />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Borders

Like the length shortcuts, border widths are limited in number and aliased in
terms of pixels, so choosing the right border width for your use case requires
little effort.

<ShortcutBorders />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Corner Radii

The corner radius variables work with the `border-radius` property and its
various constituent properties (`border-top-left-radius`,
`border-top-right-radius`, etc.)

<ShortcutCornerRadii />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

## Focus Outlines

Custom focus outlines are often achieved with the
[`box-shadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)
property. The Shortcuts package offers a large set of outline box shadows based
on its color palette.

Before applying these, you should suppress the browser's default outline using
an `outline:$none;` class. The `$none` variable provides a transparent outline
rather than removing it completely, providing a better experience in Windows
High Contrast Mode as explained
[here](https://sarahmhigley.com/writing/whcm-quick-tips/).

<ShortcutFocusOutlines />

<div className="height:$len16;"></div>

# Customization

You might have noticed earlier that the `@hacss/shortcuts` module exports a
function that returns a Hacss configuration. This allows you to provide a custom
color palette (upon which color and focus outline variables are based) and
font family (upon which font variables are based). To do so, just pass an
argument consisting of an object with keys `colors` and/or `fontFamily`.

## `colors`

The `colors` map will be included in the Hacss configuration such that each key
will be available as a variable and will be used to generate focus outline
variables. For example, given a key `red500`, the resulting configuration will
include variables `$red500`, `$outline-sm-red500`, and `$outline-lg-red500`.

Note that the default color palette above is provided when `colors` is not
specified.

## `fontFamily`

The `fontFamily` value is used in font variables. You can provide a string to be
used in all font variables; or, you can provide a map to change the font family
of each font variable listed above.

In the latter case, use each font variable name listed in the _Typography_
section above, e.g. `body2`, as the keys for the map. You can also include a
`default` key as a fallback in case you don't want to customize each font
variable explicitly.
