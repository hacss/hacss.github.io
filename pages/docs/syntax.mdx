Hacss uses a style rule syntax resembling CSS embedded within HTML classes. For
the most part, your existing CSS knowledge still applies. However, the use of
statically-analyzed HTML classes introduces some minor, but important
constraints:

1. Whitespace is strictly forbidden. Since some CSS values (e.g.
   [box shadows](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow))
   require whitespace, you can use a pair of underscores (`__`) in place of a
   space character.

2. Dynamically-generated class names are not supported because Hacss generates
   the style sheet at build time. In practice, this is not much of a limitation,
   particularly if you make good use of selectors, described below.

3. Hacss supports a large subset, but not all, of CSS. This guide will help you
   to understand which features are supported.

### Rules

A rule can include:
* declarations only, e.g. `background:red;color:white;`
* a selector, e.g. `.err{background:red;color:white}`
* an at-scope, e.g. `@sm{padding:0}`
* a combination of a selector and an at-scope, e.g. `@sm{.err{width:100%}}`

Note that declarations are always separated by semicolons. A rule consisting
_only_ of declarations is also terminated by a semicolon; however, the trailing
semicolon must be omitted for a rule that includes a selector and/or at-scope
because the closing curly brace thereof tells Hacss where the declarations end.

### Selectors

Selectors are actually useful within inline styles because they allow you to
activate various style rules conditionally, similar to what might otherwise be
accomplished with JavaScript or an external style sheet. They can also be used
to create pseudo-elements, which can sometimes optimize your markup for
accessibility or performance.

Selectors can include:
* a context
* a class list
* a pseudo-element

#### Context

A context describes the element's relationship to another element in the DOM
tree. It consists of a class list followed by a combinator.

##### Available combinators

* Ancestor: `_`
* Parent: `>`
* Adjacent sibling: `+`
* General sibling: `~`

#### Class List

A class list consists of a series of named classes followed by a series of
pseudo-classes.

Named classes begin with a `.` and consist of lowercase letters and hyphens.

Pseudo-classes begin with a `:` and consist of either:
* lowercase letters and hyphens
* `not(classes)` where `classes` is a class list
* `nth-child(expr)`, `nth-last-child(expr)`, `nth-last-of-type(expr)`, or
  `nth-of-type(expr)`, where `expr` is a formula like `even`, `odd`, `2n+1`,
  etc.
* `lang(code)`, where `code` is a standard language code like `en`, `en-US`,
  etc.

Named classes and pseudo-classes are each optional components of a class list.

#### Pseudo-element

A pseudo-element consists of `::`, followed by lowercase letters and hyphens.
Examples of pseudo-elements include:
* `::after`
* `::placeholder`

#### Selector examples

* `.err{color:red}`
* `:nth-child(odd){background:$gray50}`
* `.err_:disabled{color:pink}`
* `:checked~{text-decoration:line-through}`
* `::placeholder{color:$gray50}`

### At-scopes

At-scopes consist of `@` followed by lowercase letters and hyphens. You can use
them for
[media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) and
[feature queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports).
Each at-scope must be added to your [Hacss configuration](/docs/configuration).
Note that the `@` character is omitted within configuration.

### Variables

Variables consist of `$` followed by lowercase letters and hyphens. You can use
variables as CSS values or even interpolate them into other values. For example:
* `color:$red500;`
* `left:calc(50%+#{$len4});`

Variables must be included in your [Hacss configuration](/docs/configuration).
Note that the `$` character is omitted wthin configuration.
