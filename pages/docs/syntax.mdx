Hacss uses a style rule syntax resembling CSS embedded within HTML classes. For
the most part, your existing CSS knowledge still applies. However, the use of
statically-analyzed HTML classes introduces some minor but notable constraints:

1. Whitespace is strictly forbidden. Since some CSS values (e.g.
   [box shadows](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow))
   require whitespace, you can use a pair of underscores (`__`) in place of a
   space character.

2. Dynamically-generated class names are not supported because Hacss generates
   the style sheet at build time. In practice, this is not much of a limitation,
   particularly if you make good use of selectors, described below.

3. Hacss supports a large subset, but not all, of CSS. This guide will help you
   to understand which features are supported.

### Rules

A rule can include:
* declarations only, e.g. `background:red;color:white;`
* a selector, e.g. `.err{background:red;color:white}`
* an at-scope, e.g. `@sm{padding:0}`
* a combination of a selector and an at-scope, e.g. `@sm{.err{width:100%}}`

Note that declarations are always separated by semicolons. A rule consisting
_only_ of declarations is also terminated by a semicolon. However, for a rule
that includes a selector and/or at-scope, the trailing semicolon must be
omitted.

# Selectors

Selectors are surprisingly useful within inline styles because they allow you to
activate various style rules conditionally, similar to what might otherwise be
accomplished with JavaScript or an external style sheet. They can also be used
to create pseudo-elements, which can sometimes optimize your markup for
accessibility or performance.

Selectors can include:
* a context
* a class list
* a pseudo-element

Each of these selector components is optional.

## Context

A context describes the element's relationship to another element in the DOM
tree. It consists of a class list (described below) followed by one of the
following combinators:

* Ancestor: `_`
* Parent: `>`
* Adjacent sibling: `+`
* General sibling: `~`

## Class List

A class list consists of a series of named classes followed by a series of
pseudo-classes.

### Named Class

A named class consists of a dot followed by lowercase letters and hyphens.
Examples of named classes include:
* `.error`
* `.focus-group`

### Pseudo-class

A pseudo-class consists of a colon generally followed by a series of lowercase
letters and hyphens. For example:

* `:hover`
* `:focus-within`
* `:-ms-placeholder`

Hacss also supports a few more advanced pseudo-classes:

* `:not(<classes>)`, where `<classes>` is a class list
* `:nth-child(<expr>)`, where `<expr>` is a formula like `2n+1`, `even`, `odd`,
  etc.
* `:lang(<code>)`, where `<code>` is a standard language code like `en`,
  `en-US`, etc.

Named classes and pseudo-classes are each optional components of a class list.

## Pseudo-element

A pseudo-element consists of `::`, followed by lowercase letters and hyphens.
Examples of pseudo-elements include:

* `::after`
* `::placeholder`
* `::-webkit-slider-thumb`

## Selector rule examples

* `.err{color:red}`
* `:nth-child(odd){background:$gray50}`
* `.err_:disabled{color:pink}`
* `:checked~{text-decoration:line-through}`
* `::placeholder{color:$gray50}`

# At-scope

An at-scopes consists of an at sign followed by lowercase letters and hyphens.
You can use them for
[media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) and
[feature queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports).
Each at-scope must be added to your [Hacss configuration](./configuration). Note
that the at sign is omitted within configuration.

# Variable

A variable consists of a dollar sign followed by lowercase letters and hyphens.
You can use variables as CSS values or even interpolate them into other values.
For example:

* `color:$red500;`
* `left:calc(50%+#{$len4});`

Variables must be included in your [Hacss configuration](./configuration).
Note that the dollar sign is omitted wthin configuration.

# Priority

Hacss places at-scope rules at the end of the generated style sheet; but, beyond
that, it offers no rule ordering guarantees. You should use
[specificity](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#specificity) instead to
prioritize rules.

Sometimes two rules have the same specificity by default, and it is necessary to
increase the specificity of one of them. For example, `:hover{color:blue}` and
`:active{color:red}` have the same specificity, but you might want the red color
to be applied when both selectors match.

To increase the specificity of any rule, simply attach an exclamation point to
the end, e.g. `:active{color:red}!` or `display:none;!`

You can also increase the specificity as needed by adding more exclamation
points, e.g. `display:none;!!`

The exclamation point may remind you a bit of
[the !important exception](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#the_!important_exception),
generally regarded as a bad practice. Fortunately, Hacss' notion of _priority_
incrementally increases specificity rather than relying on the brute force of an
`!important` exception.
