  subtitle="A simple and quick way to start using Hacss">

Perhaps the easiest method to use Hacss is through its command-line interface.
This short guide will help you to install the Hacss CLI and show you how to use
it.

### Installation

The command-line interface works well with any project and does not require any
configuration or even a permanent installation. To try it out, you can start
with
[npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b):

<ShellCommand>
echo "color:red;" | npx hacss
</ShellCommand>

For better performance, you can install the
[`@hacss/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hacss/cli) package, which provides
the `hacss` command:

<ShellCommand>
npm install -g @hacss/cli
</ShellCommand>

The remainder of this guide assumes a permanent installation.

### Usage

You can run the hacss command with no arguments at any time in order to see the
available options described below.

```bash
hacss [--config <config-file>] [--output <output-file>] <sources>
```

#### Arguments

`[--config <config-file>]`

When a `--config` argument is specified, the configuration file specified by the
`<config-file>` path will be used. When not specified, `hacss.config.js`
will be used if it exists. While it is not strictly necessary to have a
configuration file, you may want to review the configuration guide to understand
when you might want to use one.

`[--output <output-file>]`

When an `--output` argument is specified, the generated CSS output will be
written to the `>output-file<` path. When not specified, the CSS output
will be written to the standard output.

`<sources>`

The [globby](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby) pattern specified here will
be used to search for source files containing CSS classes that should be
included in the generated style sheet. You can also specify a series of glob
patterns.
