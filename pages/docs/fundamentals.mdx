## CSS-in-HTML
All professional web developers are familiar with inline styles. Most developers
restrict their use to trivial prototyping exercises due to
[functional limitations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/131653/inline-style-to-act-as-hover-in-css)
or belief in a separation of concerns between markup and presentation styles. On
the other hand, newer architectures such as 
[atomic CSS](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/) and
[CSS-in-JS](https://medium.com/dailyjs/what-is-actually-css-in-js-f2f529a2757)
demonstrate that some developers prefer _colocation_ of markup and related style
rules.

Like these approaches, Hacss facilitates the colocation of markup and styles. It
combines the strongest features of atomic CSS and CSS-in-JS while minimizing the
downsides of each approach.

Hacss works by embedding CSS syntax within ordinary HTML classes. While the
class names are meaningless to the browser, Hacss analyzes them at build time
and generates a style sheet that contains the corresponding "actual" CSS. For
example, the class name `color:red;` results in the style sheet
`.color\:red\;{color:red;}`

## Constraints

While CSS-in-HTML introduces fewer constraints than other approaches, some basic
rules apply.

#### Whitespace

Whitespace cannot be used within a style rule because it is used to delimit HTML
classes. The browser would simply not apply the intended style rule if it were
allowed to contain spaces.

##### What to do instead

When spaces are required (which is not very often), double underscores may be
used in declaration values, e.g. `box-shadow:0__0__0__1px__black;`

#### Dynamic class names

Style rules cannot be constructed dynamically using string concatenation,
template literals, or otherwise. They must appear in the code as string literals
in order to be detected and processed correctly.

##### What to do instead

Hacss provides its own syntax for variables and basic interpolation.
