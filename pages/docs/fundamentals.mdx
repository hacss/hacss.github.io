## CSS-in-HTML
All professional web developers are familiar with inline styles. Most developers
restrict their use to trivial prototyping exercises due to
[functional limitations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/131653/inline-style-to-act-as-hover-in-css)
or belief in a separation of concerns between markup and presentation styles. On
the other hand, newer architectures such as 
[atomic CSS](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/) and
[CSS-in-JS](https://medium.com/dailyjs/what-is-actually-css-in-js-f2f529a2757)
demonstrate that some developers prefer _colocation_ of markup and related style
rules.

Like these approaches, Hacss facilitates the colocation of markup and styles. It
combines the strongest features of atomic CSS and CSS-in-JS while minimizing the
downsides of each approach.

Hacss works by embedding CSS syntax in class names. While these class names are
meaningless to the browser, Hacss analyzes them at build time and generates a
style sheet that contains the corresponding actual CSS.

For example, the class name `color:red;` results in the style sheet
`.color\:red\;{color:red;}`.
