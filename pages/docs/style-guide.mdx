### Atomic Classes

#### Suggestion

Use classes as single-purpose units of style. In practice, this generally means
including only one declaration per class.

#### Justification

While a single class can include multiple declarations (e.g.
`background:red;color:white;`) each additional declaration affects composability
and reuse of the rule. Separating this example into two classes
(`background:red;` and `color:white;`)
would allow the `color:white;` CSS to be reused with other classes such as
`background:blue;`

### Shorthand Properties

#### Suggestion

Use shorthand properties with caution.

#### Justification

It makes sense, in a way, to apply a class `margin:8px;` to the same element as
a class `margin-left:0;`: You would probably be trying to achieve 8-pixel top,
right, and bottom margins; and, in some cases, you may even get the expected
result. However, because `margin:8px;` sets all margins to the same value (not
just undefined ones), the left margin would be reset to 8px if the `margin:8px;`
rule appeared later in the generated style sheet.

A few options exist to make the above example work consistently, including:

* Merging the rules, which would guarantee their application in the correct
  order: `margin:8px;margin-left:0;`
* Avoiding the shorthand property altogether:
  `margin-top:8px;` `margin-right:8px;` `margin-bottom:8px;` `margin-left:0;`
* Using a more explicit form of the shorthand property:
  `margin:8px__8px__8px__0;`
* Applying [postcss-axis](https://github.com/kinday/postcss-axis) or similar to
  the Hacss-generated style sheet to enable more selective shorthand properties
  such as `margin-x` and `margin-y`.

### Rule Consistency

#### Suggestion

Write a given style rule as consistently as possible throughout the codebase,
avoiding, for example, such classes as `background:red;` and
`background-color:red;` that achieve the same effect in two different ways.

#### Justification

Because each style rule adds bytes to the generated style sheet, inconsistent
style can affect the performance of your Web site.
