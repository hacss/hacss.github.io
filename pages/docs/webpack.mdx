  subtitle="Integrate Hacss with your build process">

Hacss is a bit different than other CSS tools (e.g. preprocessors) that you may
have used with Webpack in the past. With Hacss, you don't simply author a style
sheet in a compile-to-CSS language; rather, the style sheet is entirely
generated.

While your Webpack configuration will continue to leverage
[css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) and
[style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader),
you will also use the lesser-known
[val-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/val-loader)
to generate a CSS module dynamically using Hacss.

### Installation

If you have not done so already, install the required packages:

<ShellCommand>
npm install -D val-loader css-loader style-loader @hacss/build
</ShellCommand>

### Webpack Configuration

Two small changes in the Webpack configuration (i.e. `webpack.config.js` are
necessary to enable Hacss.

#### Entry

The first change required is to insert an additional
[entry point](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/). This likely means
changing the existing `entry` value from a string to an array and adding
`@hacss/build`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: ["./src/main.js", "@hacss/build"]
};
```

#### Rule

The next step is to create a
[rule](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule) that specifies how to
load the `@hacss/build` module you referenced in the `entry` array.

As a starting point, you can use the rule configuration below, setting the
`sources` option in the `val-loader` configuration to a glob pattern that
captures all source files containing CSS classes that should be included in the
generated style sheet (e.g. HTML templates and/or UI component modules).

```javascript
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /@hacss\/build/,
        use: [
          "style-loader",
          "css-loader",
          { loader: "val-loader", options: { sources: "src/*.js" } },
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Next Steps

A generated style sheet will now be added to the page automatically. At this
point, you can add a `hacss.config.js` file alongside `webpack.config.js` if
necessary; or you can specify an additional `val-loader` option config which
contains the path to your Hacss configuration file. See the
[configuration guide](./configuration) for more details.
